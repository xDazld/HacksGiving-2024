    "- Start a VSCode server on the [Rosie dashboard](https://dh-ood.hpc.msoe.edu/pun/sys/dashboard).\n",

    "  - If you're unfamiliar, take a look at this [extension installation guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)\n",
    "  - Search for and install the extension named `Python`. It should be the one with around 3 or 4 million downloads.\n",
    "- Open the command palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P).\n",
    "- Search for and select `Python: Select Interpreter`\n",
    "- Choose the first option: `Enter interpreter path...`\n",
    "- Choose the first option again: `Find...`\n",
    "- Copy & paste `/data/ai_club/team_3_2024-25/team3-env-py312-glibc/bin/python`. Press enter.\n",
    "- Ignore all errors that may pop up (they shouldn't matter)\n",
    "- In the upper-right corner, in this notebook toolbar, select a kernel.\n",
    "- Choose `select another kernel`. (This may be skipped if you haven't used VSCode through the Rosie dashboard.)\n",
    "- Choose `Python Environments`\n",
    "- Choose `team3-env-py312-glibc`\n",
    "- Now you can run code. In the future you should only have to start from selecting a kernel.\n",
